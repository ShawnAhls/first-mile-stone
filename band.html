		<h1>About the Band</h1>
		</br>
		<h2>Ah, the joy of humble beginnings…</h2>
		</br>
		<section class="container">
			<p>
				Metallica, one of the biggest selling acts in American history, were born on October 28, 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich<br/>
				and guitar player/singer James Hetfield got together via Ulrich’s LA Recycler newspaper ad. Soon, the two had recruited<br/>
				Hetfield’s friend and housemate Ron McGovney to play bass, Dave Mustaine to play lead guitar, and taken the name<br/>
				Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area metal scene friend Ron Quintana. Their ascent was to be relatively quick,<br/>
				driven by sheer work-rate, effort and a rare musical chemistry. After hitting the opener’s circuit in LA (where they<br/>
				supported the likes of Saxon) they recorded their first ever demo No Life ‘Til Leather. The tape-trading circuit went crazy<br/>
				for it, and after repeatedly well-received shows in the Bay Area, Metallica found themselves relocating there after<br/>
				convincing bassist Cliff Burton to leave his band Trauma and replace McGovney.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				East Coast metal merchant Jon Zazula pitched the band on an album deal with his indie label	Megaforce Records and<br/>
				1983 found them traveling to New York in a stolen U-Haul to record their first album. Shortly after arriving in<br/>
				New York in	April 1983, Mustaine was replaced by Exodus	shredder Kirk Hammett and the boys hit the studio for the first<br/>
				time. The resulting debut album, Kill ‘Em All, exploded onto the scene later that year brandishing punk-encrusted,<br/>
				crunchy metal riffery, the likes of “The Four Horsemen,” “Whiplash” and “Seek and Destroy” that were hailed as instant<br/>
				classics. The stellar reception in the metal community allowed them to quickly make their second album Ride The<br/>
				Lightning with producer Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios during the summer of 1984.<br/>
				With their writing chemistry maturing at an alarming rate of knots, classic compositions such as “For Whom The Bell<br/>
				Tolls” and “Fade To Black” sat proudly with the aggression of “Fight Fire With Fire” and “Creeping Death.”<br/>
				Q Prime Management and Elektra Records both moved quickly to take the band on by the Fall of ’84, band with the<br/>
				road getting busier and more international, the bands’ stature rapidly grew.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				In late 1985, the Rassmussen/Sweet Silence combination provided the underpinning for Master Of Puppets, the band’s<br/>
				third album, which was mixed in LA with Michael Wagener and released in March 1986. “Battery,” the title track and<br/>
				epic instrumental “Orion” were among the astounding compositions, and having secured a support slot with<br/>
				Ozzy Osbourne, Master of Puppets hit the top 30 album charts and expanded their fan base beyond comprehension.<br/>
				It was some ascent. Metallica appeared unstoppable. But a heinous challenge was to be thrown at them when on<br/>
				September 27, 1986, they suffered a tragedy beyond words. On tour in Sweden, during an overnight drive the bands'<br/>
				tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on the musical growth of the band<br/>
				had been enormous, combining the DIY philosophies of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical<br/>
				theory. Faced with having to find a new path after 40+ auditions they tapped Jason Newsted from Flotsam & Jetsam<br/>
				to take over bass duties. The quartet immediately jumpedvinto a tour and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes<br/>
				titled The $5.98 E.P. Garage Days Re-Revisited the band literally did the dirty work in Ulrich's garage, which they<br/>
				helped refit into a	small studio space by hand themselves!).
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				The band recorded their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All, first with Rassmussen again taking the helm<br/>
				(this time at One On One Studios in LA) after some initial work with Mike Clink (of Appetite for Destruction fame) didn’t<br/>
				work out. Released in August 1988, the album reached #6 on the US charts, while the band was busy blowing headliners<br/>
				Van Halen off the stage during the Monsters Of Rock tour before embarking upon their first headline worldwide arena<br/>
				tour. Metallica also made their very first music video for “One,” a dark, monochromatic, violent, emotional piece which<br/>
				underscored Metallica’s thorough uniqueness.
			</p>
			</br>
			<p>
				Then came stratospheric, explosive, cacophonous worldwide success.

						of medicine or any other<br/> medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia<br/> was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration<br/> for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica,<br/> most
						notably in the songs "Dyers Eve" and "The God That Failed" from<br/> And Justice For All and The Black Album respectively.

						changed his view of what the instrument could play:<br/> "Hearing him was like hearing Eddie Van Halen doing "Eruption"<br/> for the first time: You thought, 'What instrument is that?'<br/> I loved jazz fusion and branched out from there. But Jaco
						had an edge<br/> that far exceeded his jazz persona. He was funk, he was rock,<br/> he was soul. And his whole attitude was punk." He began playing in "a lot of<br/> backyard party bands", playing music by Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Rush, and<br/> Led
						Zeppelin. He went to jazz school when he was 19 with the intention of<br/> becoming a studio musician, but he maintained his passion for rock and metal.
