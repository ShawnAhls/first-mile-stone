	<h1>About the Band</h1>
	</br>
	<h2>Ah, the joy of humble beginnings…</h2>
	</br>
	<p>
		Metallica, one of the biggest selling acts in American history, were born on<br/>
		October 28, 1981 when drummer Lars Ulrich and guitar player/singer James Hetfield<br/>
		got together via Ulrich’s LA Recycler newspaper ad. Soon, the two had recruited Hetfield’s friend<br/>
		and housemate Ron McGovney to play bass, Dave Mustaine to play lead guitar, and taken the<br/>
		name Metallica after a suggestion from Bay Area metal scene friend Ron Quintana.<br/>
		Their ascent was to be relatively quick, driven by sheer work-rate, effort and<br/>
		a rare musical chemistry. After hitting the opener’s circuit in LA (where they supported the likes of Saxon)<br/>
		they recorded their first ever demo No Life ‘Til Leather. The tape-trading circuit went crazy for it,<br/>
		and after repeatedly well-received shows in the Bay Area, Metallica found themselves<br/>
		relocating there after convincing bassist Cliff Burton to leave his band Trauma and replace McGovney.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		East Coast metal merchant Jon Zazula pitched the band on an album deal with his indie label Megaforce<br/>
		Records and 1983 found them traveling to New York in a stolen U-Haul to record their first album.<br/>
		Shortly after arriving in New York in April 1983, Mustaine was replaced by Exodus shredder<br/>
		Kirk Hammett and the boys hit the studio for the first time.<br/>
		The resulting debut album, Kill ‘Em All, exploded onto the scene later that year brandishing punk-encrusted,<br/>
		crunchy metal riffery, the likes of “The Four Horsemen,” “Whiplash” and “Seek and Destroy”<br/>
		that were hailed as instant classics. The stellar reception in the metal community<br/>
		allowed them to quickly make their second album Ride The Lightning with producer<br/>
		Flemming Rassmussen in Copenhagen at Sweet Silence Studios during the summer of 1984.<br/>
		With their writing chemistry maturing at an alarming rate of knots,<br/>
		classic compositions such as “For Whom The Bell Tolls” and “Fade To Black” sat proudly<br/>
		with the aggression of “Fight Fire With Fire” and “Creeping Death.”<br/>
		Q Prime Management and Elektra Records both moved quickly to take the band on by the Fall of ’84,<br/>
		and with the road getting busier and more international, the bands’ stature rapidly grew.<br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		In late 1985, the Rassmussen/Sweet Silence combination provided the underpinning for Master Of Puppets,<br/>
		the band’s third album, which was mixed in LA with Michael Wagener and released in March 1986.<br/>
		“Battery,” the title track and epic instrumental “Orion” were among the astounding compositions,<br/>
		and having secured a support slot with Ozzy Osbourne, Master of Puppets hit the top 30<br/>
		album charts and expanded their fan base beyond comprehension. It was some ascent. Metallica appeared unstoppable.<br/>
		But a heinous challenge was to be thrown at them when on September 27, 1986,<br/>
		they suffered a tragedy beyond words. On tour in Sweden, during an overnight drive the bands'<br/>
		tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, killing Cliff Burton. His influence on<br/>
		the musical growth of the band had been enormous, combining the DIY philosophies<br/>
		of jamming and experimenting with an acute knowledge of musical theory.<br/>
		Faced with having to find a new path after 40+ auditions they tapped Jason Newsted from Flotsam<br/>
		& Jetsam to take over bass duties. The quartet immediately jumped into a tour<br/>
		and then quickly recorded an EP of cover tunes titled The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited<br/>
		(the band literally did the dirty work in Ulrich's garage, which they helped<br/>
		refit into a small studio space by hand themselves!).
	</p>
	<p>
		The band recorded their fourth full-length album, ...And Justice For All,<br/>
		first with Rassmussen again taking the helm (this time at One On One Studios in LA)<br/>
		after some initial work with Mike Clink (of Appetite for Destruction fame) didn’t work out.<br/>
		Released in August 1988, the album reached #6 on the US charts,<br/>
		while the band was busy blowing headliners Van Halen off the stage during<br/>
		the Monsters Of Rock tour before embarking upon their first headline worldwide arena tour.<br/>
		Metallica also made their very first music video for “One,” a dark,<br/>
		monochromatic, violent, emotional piece which underscored Metallica’s thorough uniqueness.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then came stratospheric, explosive, cacophonous worldwide success.

				<h3><strong>James Hetfield (Guitar)</strong></h3>
				<img class="james" src="images/band/JamesHetfield.jpg" alt="James Hetfield Guitar" />
				<p class="personal">Hetfield was born on August 3, 1963 in Downey, California,<br/>
				the son of Cynthia Bassett (née Nourse), a light opera singer,<br/>
				and Virgil Lee Hetfield, truck driver. He is of English, German,<br/>
				Irish, and Scottish descent. He has two older half-brothers from<br/>
				his mother's first marriage and one younger sister.<br/>
				His parents divorced in 1976 when Hetfield was 13.<br/>
				They were very strict Christian Scientists,	and in accordance with their beliefs,<br/>
				they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical<br/>
				treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia<br/>
				was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration<br/>
				for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica,<br/>
				most notably in the songs "Dyers Eve" and "The God That Failed" from<br/>
				And Justice For All and The Black Album respectively.</p>

				<h3><strong>Lars Ulrich (Drummer)</strong></h3>
				<img class="james" src="images/band/LarsUlrich.jpg" alt="Lars Ulrich Drummer" />
				<p class="personal">Ulrich was born into an upper-middle-class family<br/>
				in Gentofte, Denmark; the son of Lone (née Sylvester-Hvid)<br/>
				and professional tennis player Torben Ulrich. His paternal grandfather<br/>
				was professional tennis player Einer Ulrich. His paternal grandmother,<br/>
				Ulla Meyer, was from a Jewish family; as a result, Ulrich's grandfather<br/>
				was persecuted by the Nazis during World War II.<br/>
				Saxophonist Dexter Gordon was Ulrich's godfather, and he is a<br/>
				childhood friend of musician Neneh Cherry.<br/>
                In February 1973, Ulrich's father obtained passes for five<br/>
                of his friends to a Deep Purple concert held in the same Copenhagen<br/>
                stadium as one of his tennis tournaments...</p>

				<p class="personal">Hammett was born on November 18, 1962 in San Francisco,<br/>
				and raised in the town of El Sobrante, California. He is the son of Teofila<br/>

				California.	While attending De Anza High School, he met Les Claypool of Primus,<br/>
				and they remain close friends. Hammett has a well-known passion for horror<br/>
				movies;	that stretches back to the late Sixties. After spraining his arm in a fight<br/>
				with his sister at the age of five, Hammett's parents placed him in front of<br/>
				the television. It was during this time that he first watched The Day of the Triffids.<br/>
				After that, Hammett found himself drawn to his brother's Frankenstein figures,<br/>
				and it wasn't long before he was spending his milk money on horror magazines.</p>

				<h3><strong>Robert Trujillo (Bass Guitar)</strong></h3>
				<img class="james" src="images/band/RobertTrujillo.jpg" alt="Robert Trujillo Bass Guitar" />
				<p class="personal">Roberto Agustin Trujillo was born in Santa Monica,<br/>
				California.	He is of Mexican descent. He grew up in Culver City, California,<br/>
				where his father was a teacher at Culver City High School.<br/>
				Trujillo was first exposed to music during his childhood;<br/>
				his mother was a huge fan of Motown, particularly musicians	like<br/>
				Marvin Gaye, James Brown, and Sly and the Family Stone. Trujillo stated<br/>
				that "Jaco [Pastorius] was my hero growing up", and that the iconic<br/>
				jazz bassist changed his view of what the instrument could play:<br/>
				"Hearing him was like hearing Eddie Van Halen doing "Eruption"<br/>
				for the first time: You thought, 'What instrument is that?'<br/>
				I loved jazz fusion and branched out from there. But Jaco had an edge<br/>
				that far exceeded his jazz persona. He was funk, he was rock,<br/>
				he was soul. And his whole attitude was punk."[6] He began playing in "a lot of<br/>
				backyard party bands", playing music by Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Rush, and<br/>
				Led Zeppelin. He went to jazz school when he was 19 with the intention of<br/>
				becoming a studio musician, but he maintained his passion for rock and metal.</p>
