## Testing

I have tested the website on a laptop with a Windows operating system, which I 
used Google Chrome and Firefox to test if they run the same on both of them.

I have noticed that the bar at the bottom at each page, but there was a difference 
between the Google Chrome and Firefox.

In Chrome the bar at the bottom works as link bar, but in Firefox it was a small button 
link on the left hand side. I have now corrected the bar to work as a link.

With the testing on an iPad and iPhone on the different sizes:

The gallery page, 

On an iPad there will be 5 images with iPad vertical and 3 images horizontal and
on an iPhone there will be 1 image vertically and 2 images horizontal
